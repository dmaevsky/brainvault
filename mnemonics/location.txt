on a floating island in the clouds
in a never-ending forest of giant mushrooms
in an underwater castle surrounded by jellyfish
in candyland with chocolate rivers
in a desert with pink sand dunes
in a treehouse in a colossal oak tree
inside a hidden pyramid in amazonian jungle
in a golden temple in the middle of a lake
in a labyrinth of mirrors
in a cave filled with glowing crystals
aboard a pirate ship in a stormy sea
in a library with infinite bookshelves
on a staircase spiraling into the stars
in a field of humongous sunflowers
on a space station orbiting Earth
on a snowy mountain peak with a hot spring
in a field of luminous fireflies
at a dragonâ€™s hoard of treasure
on top of a clock tower stuck at midnight
in a palace made of rainbows
in a village on the back of a whale
in a floating iceberg palace
on a spaceship docked on Mars
in a crater filled with fiery lava
at a secret alien base on the dark side of the moon
at the snowflake research facility in Antarctica
at the North pole
on top of mount Everest
on a yellow submarine in the Mariana trench
on a lush tropical island hidden in the fog
at a carnival lit up with a thousand lanterns
at a magical spring oasis in the middle of a desert
